          <p>I made this app because if I wanted to find a movie to watch I would spend hours
             scrolling through options on Netflix before maybe finding something. I would have
              to search Google and Twitter for a current top 20 list in order to find something.
               I wanted to create a more consolidated popular list of things to watch on the major
                streaming platforms.</p>

          <p>With this app I plan to make it easier to navigate popular movies on the big streaming platforms
              such as Netflix, Prime Video (Amazon), and Disney+.</p>
          
          <p>I will be adding new features to come for example a search feature with the ability to
             sort by genre. Also I will be adding a feature for showing a popular list of TV series to
              help find the next big show to binge.</p>
          
          <p>I am using <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US" atl="TMDB link" target="_blank">themoviedb.org</a> api to get all the current info I need to build my idea. 
            <b>This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.</b></p>
          
          <p>This is a Progressive Web App using Angular 9, and nguniversal (server side rendering).</p>
          
          <p>I am a web developer from Los Angeles and I enjoy building fun apps with angular. Thanks
             for stopping by! â˜º</p>
